# Find_the_Number
Python project, where your task is to ask the computer/ai, what is the number. (0-100)
Problems that need to be ironed out:
1 - You can guess the smae number multiple times.
2 - You can guess outside the range of 0-100.
3 - Once youve guess correctly the program does not end.

As of now that is all the problems, the code works as intended.
